# w1700k-stream

The host's one receiver of the W1700K's UDP export. It puts the stream in order, unpacks it and
serves it, as complex int16 IQ, to every consumer on the host through shared memory:
`w1700k-spectrum`, `sdr-recv`, or any program that maps the ring. On request it also corrects
the stream for the radio's decimation roll-off ("flatten"), in the samples themselves, so that
every consumer gets the corrected stream.

## Build and run

Needs a C++17 compiler and FFTW3 in single precision (Debian/Ubuntu:
`apt install g++ make libfftw3-dev`).

```sh
make                                   # build/w1700k-stream
make CXXFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"      # tuned for this CPU
build/w1700k-stream                    # until Ctrl-C; consumers attach any time
```

| option | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--bind IP` | `10.77.0.10` | the stream's destination address on this host (the 10G link) |
| `--port N` | `7700` | its UDP port |
| `--source IP` | unset | accept this device only; each thread receives source port `--port + thread index` |
| `--rx-threads N` | Linux: 8; macOS: 1 | UDP receive threads; with `--source`, match the unit's `export.ports` |
| `--workers N` | 6 | threads that unpack and correct |
| `--ring-mib N` | 512 | the shared ring, a power of two (512 MiB holds 0.42 s at 320 Msps) |
| `--name NAME` | `/w1700k-stream` | the POSIX shared-memory object (a file under `/dev/shm` on Linux) |
| `--report S` | 0 | a JSON status line on stdout every S seconds |

The host needs the destination address on the 10G link and an MTU of at least 8236 (9216 recommended).
On Linux, allow room for
48 MiB socket buffers (`sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=67108864`, or the kernel caps them silently
and drops datagrams under load: counted as `socket_drops`). One service owns the port: a second
receiver of the same port would take half the datagrams, so consumers read the ring instead. A
second service under the same name refuses to start; at exit the object is unlinked.

On macOS, install FFTW with `brew install fftw`. Homebrew's include and library directories
are detected during the build. Darwin does not distribute unicast UDP over `SO_REUSEPORT`
like Linux. For the default eight source ports, use:

```sh
build/w1700k-stream --bind 10.77.0.11 --source 10.77.0.1 --rx-threads 8
```

Each socket then has its own source IP/port and receive buffer (8 MiB requested on macOS).
Without `--source`, macOS uses one shared socket; this can lose data at high sample rates.
Darwin has no `SO_RXQ_OVFL`, so `socket_drops` is unavailable and stays zero; use sequence
losses (`lost`) and `netstat -s -p udp` to assess loss. See [macOS setup](../../docs/macos.md).

## The stream

The export sends one UDP datagram per completion of the unit's DMA ring: a 16-byte header
(`u32` magic `0x31524453` "SDR1", `u16` offset, `u16` slice_bytes, `u64` seq) and one slice, 8192
bytes raw (2048 samples, I in bits [29:16], Q in [13:0]) or 7168 bytes packed (of each 8 samples,
the 8th rides in the other 7's spare bits [31:30] and [15:14]); completions shorter than 4096
bytes are firmware events that share the ring.

Completions are filed by `seq` into a reorder ring (256 MiB, 0.2 s at 320 Msps). A run, one stream, begins with the
first datagram after a second of silence, after a jump in `seq`, or after a consumer asks for one
(`restart_requests`, which the spectrum server does when the receiver starts or stops). Slots are
published in order: one whose completion has arrived, a firmware event, or, once 1024 newer
completions have arrived without it, a loss. After 5 ms with nothing new, what has arrived is
published; a loss at the very end of a stream stays unpublished until more arrives. Of the
losses, `overruns` counts those that did arrive but were overwritten in the reorder ring before
the service published them: the service fell behind (CPU contention), not the export.

Every completion is checked on the way in, for the export's integrity: words of raw slices with
spare bits set (`spare_words`), and slices or 8-sample lines (28 bytes packed, 32 raw) equal to
the same slice or line one lap of the unit's capture ring (128 completions) earlier
(`stale_slices`, `stale_lines`), which a reader that overtook the capture, or a packer reading a
stale cache line, would send. Flat lines (all eight samples equal, which the radio does output)
are not compared.

## The shared memory

[`include/w1700k_stream.h`](include/w1700k_stream.h) is the interface, for C and C++: the
layout, the tag rules and helpers to map the object and read the position. In short:

- A 4 KiB header: the layout, the published position (`run`, `newest`: every slot of the run below
  `newest` is final), counters, a heartbeat (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, every 100 ms), and control words
  that consumers write.
- One 64-bit tag per slot: `(run << 40) | (index + 1)`, `index` counting the run's completions from
  0, plus a kind: `TAG_EVENT` (no samples, no sample time: the slices either side are contiguous),
  `TAG_LOST` (no samples; the sample time is lost), `TAG_FLAT` (corrected samples).
- Per slot one slice: 2048 complex samples, int16 I then int16 Q, on the scale of the radio's
  14-bit samples (full scale 8192). Uncorrected samples are the radio's, bit for bit; the int16
  range above them is the correction's headroom (a sample beyond it saturates, counted).

A reader reads a slot's tag (acquire), its samples, then the tag again: a changed tag means the
slot was overwritten meanwhile.

## The correction ("flatten")

Every sample rate's decimation attenuates the band's edges, signal and noise alike: about -2 dB
at 62 % of Nyquist, -13 dB at 87 %, -22 dB at 99 % (research ledger D293). The correction is a
129-tap linear-phase FIR (Kaiser window) whose response is the inverse of that roll-off as
measured on unit A, per rate, capped at +24 dB; it is applied zero-phase (every corrected sample
keeps its index) by overlap-save FFTs, across slice boundaries, with events skipped and losses as
zeros. Its response is within 0.15 dB of the inverse up to 0.95 x Nyquist.

It applies when a consumer asks for it (`flatten` = 1) and the radio's state, which the consumer
also writes (`radio_sample_rate`, `radio_capture_rate`, `radio_filter_hz`), says the analog filter
is as wide as the sample rate and the stream is not 640/2 (which is flat already); the service
reports what applies in `flatten_active` and `flatten_rate`. The spectrum server writes these
from the receiver's controller and the page's Flatten toggle.

Measured on unit A, band 1 at 320 Msps, from the receiver's noise floor (relative to 15..45 % of
Nyquist): without the correction -1.7 / -6.4 / -14.2 / -19.8 / -22.8 dB at 62.5 / 75 / 87.5 / 94 /
97 % of Nyquist; with it +0.9 / +0.5 / +0.1 / -0.4 / -1.1 dB. The service used 0.8 CPU cores
without it and 1.8 with it, with no loss.

## Tests

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_stream.py` from the repository root (`make check`
runs it) builds the service and runs it against a fake export over loopback.

/* RF control while streaming, as firmware commands: the register programs our WM runs for one
 * MT7996_PROBE_CTL_OP_RF op (hw/mt7996/probe_page.h "RF commands"), so the host names no radio,
 * PHY or A-die register in regular operation.
 *
 * Each builder writes raw control ops ({op, a, b, c} as posted to the CTL mailbox, an A-die
 * register as MT7996_PROBE_CTL_AREG(die, k, index)) into the caller's buffer: op for op the
 * program host/w1700k/rf.py built on the host before (mt7977_retune / mt7976_retune, set_gain,
 * set_filter, set_trim, status, synth_locks, select_band_program), with the tune change and
 * GAIN_APPLY addition described below. The control interpreter (stream/ctl.h) runs the program
 * inside the RF op exactly as it runs a posted one: DELAY, an unmet APOLL and the SAR's settling return and resume on its next
 * call, so a retune costs a running stream only the time its register accesses take. Nothing here
 * touches hardware or keeps state between builds (rfctl_build's buffer aside).
 *
 * Bands: band b is A-die die b. Band 0: the MT7976, LO 2.08..2.74 GHz, SX0 in k 0, 4 chains;
 * bands 1 and 2: MT7977, LO 4.65..7.41 GHz, SX in k 4, 4 and 5 chains.
 *
 * A builder returns the number of ops written; 0 when it refuses its arguments or the program does
 * not fit `max` (RFCTL_MAX_OPS fits every program).
 *
 * rfctl_tune(band, hz)     The LO of band to hz (Hz). MT7977: ratio 5/8 below
 *     MT7977_FW_SPLIT_MHZ, 3/4 from it; the SX80_E3 presets of the frequency's Group (mt7977.h
 *     MT7977_SX_E3_ROWS bounds; below the first Group the first, above the last the last, clamped
 *     to the ratio's Groups) on the SX bank, the RCD rows of its range on k 4..0, then mt7977.h
 *     "Retune sequence" steps 1..9 with the SAR as one op. MT7976: mt7976.h "SX0 retune" with
 *     its presets at ratio 5/16. Then four health reads and the firmware's frequency note (LO in
 *     kHz, rounded half to even like rf.py's round()). *health: the index of the first health
 *     read, the SX status (its [1:0] != 0: the VCO did not lock), then Vtune, the comparator and
 *     the done word (MT7977) or band word (MT7976). *actual_hz: the LO the words give, rounded
 *     to the nearest Hz (ties to even, rf.py's round()).
 *     The presets are always written. rf.py first read the six bin-dependent preset registers in
 *     a separate program and left the 45 preset writes out when they already held the target's
 *     column (_presets_needed): a second round trip, and a guess that no one else wrote them.
 *     Writing them always costs a retune within one bin the presets' SPI time (sx.h: 1.5 ms of WM
 *     time instead of 0.8 ms); the stream does not notice either.
 * rfctl_gain(band, lna, lpf)  Every chain's RXGAIN forced to (lna 0..4, lpf 0..9) in sets A
 *     and B (phy.h MT7996_PHY_RXGAIN_FORCE_AB), or handed to the AGC with lna = RFCTL_GAIN_AGC;
 *     then every chain's word read back.
 *     GAIN_APPLY adds an RX-disable pulse and 20 ms settling while ICAP0 is
 *     stopped. GAIN remains available for timing experiments with raw writes.
 * rfctl_filter(band, mhz)  Every chain's analog filter to mhz (20, 40, 80, 160, 320) at whatever
 *     bandwidth the channel has: rfctl_filter_regs' ADIE_RX_BW and ADIE_CHSET_933, on the MT7976
 *     also MT7976_RXF_125 [22:20] and the RC trim; then every chain's ADIE_RX_BW_RB read (on band
 *     0 at 320 MHz it reads 3).
 * rfctl_trim(band, code)   Every chain's ADIE_RCTRIM code (0..31) with ADIE_RCTRIM_SW set.
 * rfctl_status(band)       SX INT, FRAC, CFG and status, the frequency note, every chain's
 *     ADIE_RX_BW, then every chain's RXGAIN.
 * rfctl_locks()            The SX status of bands 0, 1 and 2.
 * rfctl_band(band)         ICAPCR8 of the three ICAPs = band (the band the stream captures),
 *     between two reads of ICAP0's write pointer CR9 that place the switch in the ring.
